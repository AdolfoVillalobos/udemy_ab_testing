# Udemy A/B Testing

Repo for my code in the udemy a/b testing course (using R)


In the course, i explored the differences between A/B testing, Multivariate texting and Multi-Armemd Bandits testing. The main difference between the first and the last is that the first focuses on sstatistical signifcance in the assessment of product variation, while MAB focuses on minimizing regret (e.g.: cost) neglecting significance and insight about the product.


Here are also some notes I took to better understand the concepts.
